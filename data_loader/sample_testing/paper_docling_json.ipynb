      "  title: Impact of Co-occurrence on Factual Knowledge of Large Language Models\n",
      "  authors: ['Cheongwoong Kang', 'Jaesik Choi']\n",
      "  abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often make factually incorrect responses despite their success in various applications. In this paper, we hypothesize that relying heavily on simple co-occurrence statistics of the pre-training corpora is one of the main factors that cause factual errors. Our results reveal that LLMs are vulnerable to the co-occurrence bias, defined as preferring frequently co-occurred words over the correct answer. Consequently, LLMs struggle to recall facts whose subject and object rarely co-occur in the pre-training dataset although they are seen during finetuning. We show that co-occurrence bias remains despite scaling up model sizes or finetuning. Therefore, we suggest finetuning on a debiased dataset to mitigate the bias by filtering out biased samples whose subject-object co-occurrence count is high. Although debiased finetuning allows LLMs to memorize rare facts in the training set, it is not effective in recalling rare facts unseen during finetuning. Further research in mitigation will help build reliable language models by preventing potential errors.

      "üìå Paper topic and main contributions:\n",
      "The paper investigates the effect of co-occurrence statistics on the ability of large language models to correctly answer simple factual questions (of the subject-relation-object form). The paper specifically checks whether simple co-occurrences between the subject and the object in the pretraining data, can lead the models to incorrectly answer factual questions where the co-occurrence diverges from the correct answer. As it is difficult to check this causal relation by direct manipulation (given the enormous costs of pretraining large language models), a correlation study was conducted. Results show correlation between the co-occurrence statistics of a triplet and the ability of the model to answer correctly questions on it. \n",
      "The paper further explores mitigation strategies to combat this bias. Two approaches are explored: debiased finetuning and knowledge editing. The former approach presents limited gains. Knowledge editing does show promise, but may be restricted as it requires weeding out the incorrect facts one by one (if I understand correctly). It may also cause unintended changes to unrelated facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "üìå Reasons to accept:\n",
      "-- The paper addresses an important and timely topic, namely the ability of LLMs to act as knowledge bases.\n",
      "-- The related work section is very elaborate and provides insight into the field at hand.\n",
      "-- The arguments of the paper are well-presented, and the writing is generally clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "üìå Reasons to reject:\n",
      "-- I am somewhat confused as to the exact claim the paper is making. While the results clearly show a correlation between the co-occurrence statistics of a triplet and the performance of the model on it, it is not clear to me whether this in fact proves that there is a bias where such simple surface statistics push the language model astray from making the right prediction. What it does show is that questions where the degree of co-occurrence is smaller are more difficult for the model. The introduction reads ‚Äúin which frequently co-occurred words are preferred over the correct answer.‚Äù I could not see how the experiments directly make this point. Simple correlation seems to me insufficient in this case, since making mistakes with little co-occurrence doesn‚Äôt mean that there is a different option with higher co-occurrence.\n",
      "In order to show that the behavior is biased, I would expect the paper to shows that the surface statistics interfere in some sense with the prediction of the model, in a way that would make it predict such answer even when it is not true. For example, I would have expected the paper to examine questions which we would expect (based on their prevalence in the training data) the model to answer correctly, and show that in these cases it tends to make more errors where there is a strong collocation and that the mistakes is towards the collocating words. If the paper indeed makes this kind of more subtle claim and I have missed it, I would welcome a response from the authors on this matter. Thank you. \n",
      "Following rebuttal: the results you have posted are helpful and address this comment. Please include them in the next version.\n",

      "-- The point about memorization is unclear to me. Why does co-occurrence imply memorization? on the contrary, if the model \"saw\" the correct answer and was overridden by co-occurrence this is the opposite of memorization.\n",
      "-- Why is knowledge editing a mitigation strategy. Obviously wrong knowledge should be corrected, but this is independent of the cause of the mistake, which is the subject of this paper, isn't it?\n",

      "The paper argues that large language models suffer from the so-called 'co-occurrence bias', i.e. when asked a factual question they tend to assign higher probabilities to words that have higher co-occurrence statistics with the query instead of the correct answer. The authors show that this bias persists in models of different sizes and cannot be effectively removed using fine-tuning, but can be partially remedied with knowledge editing. In order to prove their point, the authors introduce a series of term-frequency baselines, two of which are co-occurrence statistics. They show that these statistics can be used as a shortcut feature (in some settings, selecting the most frequently co-occurrent word results in 60% accuracy on the test set) and explain the actual behaviour of the models to a large extent. The paper explores two mitigation strategies: fine-tuning on a debiased version of the training dataset and rank-one model editing (ROME). While fine-tuning is not particularly effective, ROME shows promising results on frequent relation-like facts but does not really help with rarer ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "üìå Reasons to accept:\n",
      "In my opinion, the most interesting aspect of the paper are the frequency baselines introduced to analyse the structure of the training dataset and to explain the behaviour of the models. They bring the co-occurrence/frequency bias influencing the behaviour of the models to fore, and the analysis is convincing.\n",
      "\n",
      "üìå Reasons to reject:\n",
      "The main point of the paper -- that LLMs suffer from co-occurrency bias -- is not particularly new. Other papers investigating this issue are mentioned in the Related Work section. The authors claim that their work is the fist \"to investigate the effects of finetuning on the correlation between term frequency statistics and factual knowledge of LLMs\" (ll. 136--139), but there is no discussion of why fine-tuning should help at all, and in the end it does not, which amounts to a weak negative result. The section on mitigating occupies less than 1.5 pages and does not contain any methodological insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "üìå Questions for the authors:\n",
      "In the discussion of fine-tuning in lines 347--348, it is said that \"the models may learn appropriate cadidate sets during finetuning.\" Does this mean that there is some amount of knowledge leakage in fine-tuning and that the testing set-up is slightly different from the zero-shot setting?\n",
      "In Figure 6, we see that the accuracy of the models' outputs _improves_ when the conditional probability of the object given the subject goes down from around 1/64 to 0. This goes against the general trend of the positive association between conditional probability and accuracy. Is there any interpretation for this?\n",
      "\n",
      "üìå Typos grammar style and presentation improvements:\n",
      "Some of the statements in the paper look confusing. In lines 87--89, the authors point out that \"relying heavily on co-occurrence is not appropriate for understanding the accurate meaning behind words.\" This is probably true, but this is all we have when training LLMs, and the paper does not propose a way out. Similarly, in lines 173--174, the authors state that \"relying on co-occurrence implies simple memorization.\" Again, the relationship between co-occurrence and memorization is more complicated, and equating one with the other seems erroneous.\n",

      "The paper proposes a framework to probe the shortcuts in LLMs. The framework firsts test the accuracy of LLM on factual knowledge dataset like LAMA.

      "Large language models (LLMs) often make factually incorrect responses despite their success in various applications. In this paper, we hypothesize that relying heavily on simple cooccurrence statistics of the pre-training corpora is one of the main factors that cause factual errors. Our results reveal that LLMs are vulnerable to the co-occurrence bias, defined as preferring frequently co-occurred words over the correct answer. Consequently, LLMs struggle to recall facts whose subject and object rarely co-occur in the pre-training dataset although they are seen during finetuning. We show that co-occurrence bias remains despite scaling up model sizes or finetuning. Therefore, we suggest finetuning on a debiased dataset to mitigate the bias by filtering out biased samples whose subject-object co-occurrence count is high. Although debiased finetuning allows LLMs to memorize rare facts in the training set, it is not effective in recalling rare facts unseen during finetuning. Further research in mitigation will help build reliable language models by preventing potential errors. The code is available at https://github.com/CheongWoong/ impact_of_cooccurrence .\n",

      "Natural language processing has seen significant progress in recent years with the advent of large language models (LLMs) (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2020). Factual knowledge probing benchmarks like LAMA have demonstrated that LLMs have a high capacity to recall factual knowledge (Petroni et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2021). However, factual knowledge stored in LLMs may not always be correct (Elazar et al., 2021; Cao et al., 2021). Understanding the reasons behind such inaccuracies is critical for developing more accurate and reliable language models. Recent studies point out that LLMs often learn short-\n",

We suspect that relying on co-occurrence statistics of the pre-training corpora is one of the main factors that cause such behaviors (Razeghi et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022; Elazar et al., 2022; Kandpal et al., 2023; Kazemi et al., 2023).\n",

      "In this work, we investigate the effects of cooccurrence statistics of the pre-training data on factual knowledge in LLMs. First, we adopt the LAMA dataset (Petroni et al., 2019) to probe factual knowledge, represented as a subject-relationobject triple. Then, we analyze the correlation between co-occurrence statistics and performance on\n",
      "\n",
      "factual knowledge probing. Specifically, we count co-occurrences of word pairs in the pre-training corpora. We focus on subject-object co-occurrence, motivated by the concept of distant supervision, which shows that a sentence often contains the triple if it contains a subject and an object of a triple (Mintz et al., 2009). Figure 1 illustrates an overall framework of our correlation analysis between cooccurrence counts and factual knowledge of LLMs. We hypothesize that the target model would generate the most frequently co-occurring word if it heavily relies on co-occurrence. In this simulated example, given the fact 'Canada'-'capital'-'Ottawa', the target model generates the most frequently cooccurring word 'Toronto', which is not the correct answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "We test our hypothesis with GPT-Neo (Black et al., 2021) and GPT-J (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021), which are open-source versions of GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020). We compute co-occurrence statistics of the Pile dataset (Gao et al., 2020), on which the target models are pre-trained. We show that the factual probing accuracy of LLMs highly correlates with subject-object co-occurrence, leading to failures in recalling rare facts. Although scaling up model sizes or finetuning boosts the overall performance on factual knowledge probing, they do not resolve co-occurrence bias, in which frequently co-occurred words are preferred over the correct answer. Besides, we find that a significant portion of facts in the LAMA dataset can be recalled by simply generating the object with the highest co-occurrence count. Although cooccurrence is necessary to recall factual knowledge, it is not sufficient. Therefore, relying heavily on co-occurrence is inappropriate for understanding the accurate meaning behind words.\n",

      "Relying heavily on the co-occurrence statistics may lead to hallucinations (Fish, 2009; Maynez et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2023) if the co-occurrence statistics reflect factually incorrect information. Therefore, we suggest finetuning LLMs on the debiased LAMA, constructed by filtering out biased samples whose subject-object co-occurrence count is high. Although finetuning on the debiased dataset allows LLMs to learn rare facts that appear in the training set, it is not generalizable to test cases.\n",

Specifically, we demonstrate that LLMs prefer frequently co-occurring words, which often override the correct answer, especially when the correct answer rarely co-occurs with the subject. While existing studies only show that the performance of LLMs correlates with co-occurrence, our results provide evidence and reasons for that. We hope our results spur future work on mitigating co-occurrence bias to build accurate and reliable language models.\n",

      "\n",
      "There have been recent attempts to tune input prompts to improve the performance of LLMs further (Liu et al., 2023b; Lester et al., 2021; Li and Liang, 2021; Qin and Eisner, 2021; Liu et al., 2022, 2023a). However, directly optimizing prompts is not trivial since changes in the input space may cause non-monotonic performance changes (Hu et al., 2022). Especially, Fichtel et al. (2021) demonstrate that finetuned LMs outperform prompt-tuned LMs on factual knowledge probing tasks. Although LLMs, such as GPT-3 and T0, were primitively designed to perform well on various tasks without finetuning (Brown et al., 2020; Sanh et al., 2022), recent work shows that finetuning improves the linguistic capabilities of LLMs substantially (Ouyang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022). Therefore, we consider finetuned LMs for analysis.\n",

      "2.2 Term Frequency and Model Behaviors\n",
      "\n",
      "There have been several approaches to understanding the effects of training data on model behaviors. Specifically, recent studies observe a correlation between pre-training term frequency and model behaviors (Kassner et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022; Razeghi et al., 2022; Kandpal et al., 2023; Elazar et al., 2022). Our work offers unique contributions by providing additional evidence and insights with in-depth analysis. Specifically, we verify that (1) LLMs learn co-occurrence bias from the pre-training data, preferring frequently co-occurred words over the correct answer, which is especially problematic when recalling rare facts, and (2) co-occurrence bias is not overcome either by scaling up model sizes or finetuning.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.3 Spurious Features\n",
      "\n",
      "A spurious correlation refers to a relationship in which variables are correlated but does not imply causation due to a coincidence or a confounding factor (Simon, 1954). LMs often learn shortcuts relying on spurious features, such as word overlap, type matching, misprimes, and surface form, which mostly come from dataset bias (Gururangan et al., 2018; McCoy et al., 2019; Wallace et al., 2019; Kassner and Sch√ºtze, 2020; Poerner et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022). For example, if a heuristic (e.g. word overlap, surface form) frequently cooccurs with specific labels, the models may learn the shortcut relying on the heuristic to make decisions. Although spurious features may be helpful in generating plausible responses, it is not appropriate for accurate semantic understanding. Our work suggests that co-occurrence statistics of the pre-training data may work as spurious features, causing hallucinations (Fish, 2009; Maynez et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2023) or biased responses (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Caliskan et al., 2017; Bommasani et al., 2021).\n",

      "2.4 Memorization\n",
      "\n",
      "LLMs have been shown to memorize information in training data and generate it verbatim at test time (Emami et al., 2020; Feldman and Zhang, 2020; McCoy et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2022; Akyurek et al., 2022; Magar and Schwartz, 2022; Carlini et al., 2023). Memorization implies that LLMs recall memorized information rather than generalizing to new inputs based on learned knowledge. Although recent studies indicate that memorization poses privacy risks (Song and Shmatikov, 2019; Carlini et al., 2019, 2021; Kandpal et al., 2022), it is necessary for nearoptimal generalization when learning from a longtail distribu...\n"
